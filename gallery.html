	  <img src="images/MowgliThumb%2Ejpg" alt="Mowgli the Dog" width="640" height="480">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">This is Mowgli, our Australian Shepherd. He grew up on a farm surrounded by cats, and we suspect he thinks he is a cat given some of his eccentricities. Doesn't like strangers, but really he's a big sweetheart.</div>
  </div>

      <img src="images/MishaThumb%2Ejpg" alt="Misha the Cat" width="640" height="480">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">This is Misha, our oldest cat and a representative of the previous cat administration. She's getting a bit chubby in her later years, but she still enjoys roaming around the property and trying to hunt.</div>
  </div>

    <a target="_blank" href="images/Heera%2Ejpg">
      <img src="images/HeeraThumb%2Ejpg" alt="Heera the Cat" width="640" height="480">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">This is Heera, a pure Maine Coon and mother to our other 3 cats. We got her from a family in North York who were rehoming their cat, and didn't know that she was pregnant. Great value cat!</div>

      <img src="images/BootsThumb%2Ejpg" alt="Boots the Cat" width="640" height="480">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">This is Boots, who like his siblings is a Maine Coon / Persian mix and around 2 years old. He's a big, strong boy, up to 18 pounds at his heaviest, with a dainty and rarely-used meow that we find endearing.</div>

      <img src="images/WalterThumb%2Ejpg" alt="Walter the Cat" width="640" height="480">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">This is Walter, who inherited an all-white coat and blue eyes, presumably from his father. Apparently white cats with blue eyes are typically deaf, but Walter can hear just fine. Loves a good cuddle.</div>

    <a target="_blank" href="images/Roxie%2Ejpg">
      <img src="images/RoxieThumb%2Ejpg" alt="Roxie the Cat" width="640" height="480">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">This is Roxie, who was the adorable runt of her litter. She's much smaller than her brothers and mother, with shorter legs and body but plenty of fluff. Very independent, but also sweet and playful.</div>
