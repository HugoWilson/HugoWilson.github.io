	<!-- First of the text body sections -->
	<section class="introduction-section">
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>I'm an Environmental Technologist and GIS student with a passion for conservation and rehabilitation projects.</p>
		<p>I love animals, technology, games of all kinds, and (watching) sports.</p>
	</section>
	<!-- Second text body section -->
	<section class="location-section">
		<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
		<p>I was born and raised in Port Perry, Ontario. (See the upper map on the right!) </p>
		<p>I still live in a rural area not far from my hometown. </p>
		<p>My parents are both British immigrants, and I hold dual Canadian/British citizenship as a result. </p>
	</section>
	<!-- Third text body section -->
	<section class="education-section">
		<h2>My Educational Background</h2>
		<p>Growing up, I was always drawn to the natural spaces around my town, especially the Durham Regional Forest where I volunteered during the summer.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, my desire to spend more of my time in nature is what drew me to study Environmental Technology at Fleming College.</p>
		<p>During my first stint at Fleming, I found that I was especially proficient in certain software elements of the program, including GIS.</p>
		<p>I even ended up using my GIS education while working a student job with York Region's Transportation Department.</p>
		<p>A couple years after graduating, I decided to return to school and take a post-graduate course to further my GIS knowledge.</p>
		<p>I'm currently enrolled in the Fleming College GIS Applications Specialist program.</p>
	</section>
	<!-- Final text body section, this one with heading and subheadings for FAQ -->
	<section class="questions-section">
		<h2>A Few (in)Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
		<h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
		<p>My goal since I decided to enter the environmental sector has been to find work with a conservation authority, municipality, or provincial/federal environmental agency. I'm particularly interested in jobs that combine field studies in a natural setting with GIS, imagery, or reporting.</p>
		<h3>What's up with the picture of vultures in the header?</h3>
		<p>I took that picture one morning while walking to class at Frost Campus! The location where that photo was taken is on a brownfield right next to the college (it's marked in the lower map on the right of this page).</p>
		<h3>Do you have any pets?</h3>
		<p>Yes, perhaps even too many! I live with 5 cats and a dog, who you can see photos of by <a href="gallery%2Ehtml">clicking here!</a></p>
