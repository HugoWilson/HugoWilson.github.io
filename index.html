		<h1>My Educational Background</h1>
		<p>Growing up, I was always drawn to the natural spaces around my town, especially the Durham Regional Forest where I volunteered during the summer.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, my desire to spend more of my time in nature is what drew me to study Environmental Technology at Fleming College.</p>
		<p>During my first stint at Fleming, I found that I was especially proficient in certain software elements of the program, including GIS.</p>
		<p>I even ended up using my GIS education while working a student job with York Region.</p>
		<p>A couple years after graduating, I decided to return to school and take a post-graduate course to further my GIS knowledge.</p>
		<p>I'm currently enrolled in the Fleming College GIS Applications Specialist program.</p>
